# ================================
# Middleware Configuration
# ================================
# Middlewares define behaviors applied to requests before they reach the backend.
#
#   Extra Config & GitOps
# - If `extraConfig` is enabled in goma.yml and `watch` is turned on, you can
#   split routes and middlewares into multiple files.
# - All files must be located in the directory defined in goma.yml.
# - Any change to those files will trigger an automatic reload â€” no need to restart Goma Gateway.
# - This makes it easy to follow GitOps practices: just commit and push your changes,
#   then pull them into production to update routes and middlewares automatically.
#
#  Notes:
# - Middlewares are executed in the order they are defined in the route.
# - You can mix and match multiple middleware types for flexible behavior.
